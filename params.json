It's meant to be an easy to use, easy to extend solution for voxel games. Voxelmetric is currently in alpa so expect breaking changes and incomplete documentation. I am currently mainating it alone and making changes as I learn but if anyone else wants to help they should feel free to make a pull request. Also use the issues to highlight bugs and things so that need to be adressed.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n#### Terrain Generation\r\nGenerate relistic looking terrain with caves and landmarks like trees.\r\n\r\n#### Ambient Occlusion\r\nDarkening in the corners between blocks makes the terrain look more realisticly lit.\r\n\r\n#### Saving and Loading\r\nSave and load your changes to the world at will.\r\n\r\n#### Infinite Terrain\r\nTerrain generates around a given object and is removed when you move too far away, there are no borders or limits.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\nLighting is currently in development but is too slow to enable by default just yet. There should also be some documentation implementing the framework and extending common things like block types.\r\n\r\nSee [AlexSTV.com](AlexSTV.com) for updates.\r\n","google":"UA-58007562-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
